Design a Winforms personal phone/address book using a Dictionary collection.
```
Write a Person class to store details of a person like:
    FirstName
    LastName
    Mobile Phone
    Work Phone
    Address
```
Provide a grid to display all, add more, delete (with confirmation message), and search by name.

Search should show details of person searched. Use the name of the person as the key.
